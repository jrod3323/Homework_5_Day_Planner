## Usage

This project is a Daily Planner. The tool is designed to provide the user with a means of scheduling their day.

On the table, hours that have already past will be shown as grey.  The current active hour is shown as red, and future hours are populated as green.

A user will input their plans for each hour in the text area provided.  After inputting the data, they will click save to save the data to local storage.  This allows data to persist on reload of the page.  

At the end of the day or beginning of a new day, the user can click the Clear Schedule button at the bottom to clear the Scheduler.

Of note, the scheduler will auto update the time every 60 seconds and it will also refresh the Scheduler every 60 seconds to ensure that each our slot is populated with the correct color if the scheduler is left open.
